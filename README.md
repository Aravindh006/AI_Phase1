- Scikit-Learn (for loading the trained prediction model)
- Natural Language Processing libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, or similar, for chatbot language understanding)
- Relevant machine learning libraries and models (for diabetes prediction)
- Any additional libraries or tools specific to your chatbot implementation

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install flask scikit-learn nltk spacy  # Add other dependencies as needed


## Installation
1.Clone this repository to your local machine:
